## Middleware

A function that runs on the server before rendering the UI, where you can perform authentication, permission checks, etc., is particularly useful when you want to run a sandbox page in a production environment.

## Defining middleware

You can directly pass the server logic to be executed in the `middleware` parameter, as `withSandbox()` will render a server component.

```tsx title="app/sandbox/page.tsx"
import { seedUsers } from '@/actions/users';
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth';
import { withSandbox } from 'next-sandbox';
import { forbidden } from 'next/navigation';

export default withSandbox({
  middleware: async () => { // [!code ++]
    const user = await auth(); // [!code ++]
    if (user.role !== 'admin') { // [!code ++]
      forbidden(); // [!code ++]
    } // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
  functions: [
    {
      name: 'Seed Users',
      function: seedUsers,
    },
  ],
});
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Protect server actions

Due to server actions, Next.js allocates a separate POST endpoint for it at build time, which is unrelated to the middleware we define, as middleware only restricts the rendering of the UI. Therefore, the best practice is to also **perform strict authentication within server actions**, which ensures that even if someone directly accesses the server actions endpoint, they cannot execute it successfully.
