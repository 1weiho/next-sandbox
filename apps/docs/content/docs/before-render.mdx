## `beforeRender()`

An async function that runs on the server before rendering the UI, where you can perform authentication, permission checks, etc., is particularly useful when you want to run a sandbox page in a production environment.

## Usage

You can directly pass the server logic to be executed in the `beforeRender` parameter, since `withSandbox()` renders a Server Component. This means your logic will run on the server before the Sandbox UI is rendered.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```tsx title="app/sandbox/page.tsx"
import { auth } from '@/lib/auth';
import { withSandbox } from 'next-sandbox';
import { forbidden } from 'next/navigation';

export default withSandbox({
  beforeRender: async () => { // [!code ++]
    const user = await auth(); // [!code ++]
    if (user.role !== 'admin') { // [!code ++]
      forbidden(); // [!code ++]
    } // [!code ++]
  }, // [!code ++]
  // ...
});
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

## Protect server actions

Due to server actions, Next.js allocates a separate POST endpoint for it at build time, which is unrelated to the `beforeRender` we define, as it only restricts the rendering of the UI. Therefore, the best practice is to also **perform strict authentication within server actions**, which ensures that even if someone directly accesses the server actions endpoint, they cannot execute it successfully.
